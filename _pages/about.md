My mission in life is to hold a career position where I can influence the world encouragingly and insightfully. Thus, I continue to hold comprehensive leadership and professional growth opportunities: handling unique situations, communicating, speaking publicly, working with various individuals, and always working towards accomplishing goals efficiently and delivering superior results.

In addition, I'm currently a senior machine learning researcher at Valeo, EGYPT, and a master's holder from Cairo University, EGYPT.

I am an ambitious individual looking for a bright career path. I am seeking a challenging position that will be the appropriate place to apply my skills and knowledge to make significant contributions in different fields.
